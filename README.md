Stock Data


Hello graders,

I wrote the code to run to your specifications.
Currently, my computer can't handle the task to run the code on the Multiple year stock data.
It has frozen numerous times. But it has completed the alphabetical testing excel data.

As of now, I set the for loop to run from j = 2 to 10000.
And I can got results that I can screenshot for you.
Please run the code on the Multiple year stock data yourself.

Thanks,
Jeremy
